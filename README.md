# 3DS-Gamecard
Eagle Board for nintendo 3DS Gamecard Cartidge

# Dimensions
All the measurements on this board are 99% acurate they may differe a bit but it doesn't affect the performance of the cartridge when inserted in the 3DS slot.

The only major difference in this design is the height, as the **official card height is 30.40mm** i extended it a bit to be able to solder some headers and test the signals.
